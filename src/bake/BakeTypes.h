 * POD records the raster, projection and map kernels pass between them. TexelSample and HitRecord are plain 16-byte
 * aligned structs with no pointers so a GPU backend can upload them as they are (std430 layout).
 *
 * Pipeline, per group and low mesh and UDIM tile, a band of texel rows at a time:
 *
 *   TexelRaster (stratified samples on the low's UVs)
 *     -> Backend::traceProjection (one HitRecord per sample, against the group's own highs only)
 *     -> Backend::shade, once per map, reusing the same hits
 *     -> accumulate into the output texture the map's file name resolves to (several groups may share one)
 *   then per texture: resolve (average, exact vote or coverage), MapDef::finalize, Backend::dilate, write.
